# OStim Scene XML Converter tool

The OStim SML converter tool starts the conversion process from OSA xml files to OStim json files. 

Run the tool with `XmlConverter.exe <input> <output>` or omit the input and output and it will ask for values.

It will trawl the folders for valid scene files, convert them to json and dump them into the output folder
